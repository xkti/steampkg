# steampkg

steamcmd wrapper to download and compress games

rec'd usage: `./steampkg.sh -u <username> <appid>`

todo:

 - allow selection for beta branches (unsure), bitness, language
 - clean up if conditions, and organise code
 - add documentation about username.vdf usage
 - maybe make it so i don't need a secondary python script?
